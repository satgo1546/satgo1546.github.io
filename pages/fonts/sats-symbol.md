🂠🃒🂭 The playing cards are taken from [the standard card deck in libkdegames](https://invent.kde.org/games/libkdegames/-/blob/master/src/carddecks/svg-standard/standard.svg), which was traced from [cards.dll bitmaps](https://kare.com/microsoft/) in [this commit](https://invent.kde.org/games/libkdegames/-/commit/5c83b3599b313cf77fa1c2336551a70673d01a1c).

😾🐖 Emojis are taken from Noto Emoji ([monochrome](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji), [color](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji), [animated](https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-animation/).

🯱🯲🯳 The segmented digits, dot and comma are copied from [SegmentTL](../segment-tl/), but with spacing dot and comma.

🆂🅰 𝗠 The sans-serif bold letters and digits resemble those in Helvetica Neue LT Std 77 Bold Condensed, but with different metrics.
