🂠🃒🂭 The playing cards are taken from [the standard card deck in libkdegames](https://invent.kde.org/games/libkdegames/-/blob/master/src/carddecks/svg-standard/standard.svg), which was traced from cards.dll bitmaps in [this commit](https://invent.kde.org/games/libkdegames/-/commit/5c83b3599b313cf77fa1c2336551a70673d01a1c).

😾 The pouting cat face is taken from [Animated Noto Color Emoji](https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-animation/).

🯱🯲🯳 The segmented digits, dot and comma are copied from [SegmentTL](../segment-tl/), but with spacing dot and comma.

🆂🅰 𝗠 The sans-serif bold letters and digits resemble those in Helvetica Neue LT Std 77 Bold Condensed, but with different metrics.

## Wishlist

- True animated pouting cat face with a variation axis TIME
