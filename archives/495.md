üòæ Since [monads are not a good choice as topic for one's first Haskell blog entry](https://wiki.haskell.org/What_a_Monad_is_not#Monads_are_not_a_good_choice_as_topic_for_your_first_Haskell_blog_entry), this post is doomed to fail. It is advised to stop reading now and turn to proper introductory materials instead. I recommend [<cite>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</cite> ¬ß Input and Output](https://learnyouahaskell.com/input-and-output).

Nonetheless, [there's a reason why monad tutorials are an evergreen business](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/). Note that the book chapter recommended above has not a single mention of monads (other than in the package name `Control.Monad`), let alone category theory.

Introduction
------------

In Haskell, *monadic types* ‚Äî types having an instance for the `Monad` class ‚Äî can be thought of as *abstract descriptors* of *computations* which are inherently *composable* ‚Äî smaller monadic expressions (*actions*) can be used to build larger ones.

In JavaScript, *Promise implementations* ‚Äî classes implementing the `PromiseLike` interface ‚Äî can be thought of as *abstract descriptors* of *computations* which are inherently *composable* ‚Äî smaller promises can be used to build larger ones.

This *monadic interface* (as specified by `Monad`) provides actions additional flexibility in separating:

This *thenable interface* (as specified by `PromiseLike`) provides actions additional flexibility in separating:

- the *time of composition*: when it is defined;

- the *time of execution*: when it is used;

- the *mode of computation*: what else it can do, in addition to emitting its *single* (hence the name) output value.

- the *time of composition*: when it is defined;

- the *mode of computation*: what else it can do, in addition to specify what to do *after* (hence the name) the resolved value is known.

Monadic operations
------------------

Thenable methods
----------------

Ideally, each monadic type in Haskell should satisfy the *[monad laws](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad_Laws)* by providing two basic operations:

Ideally, each Promise implementation in JavaScript should comply with *[Promises/A+ specification](https://promisesaplus.com/)* by providing two basic methods:

- `return :: Monad m => a -> m a`:

  | argument | `:: a`   | another Haskell value                               |
  | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | result   | `:: m a` | an action, merely *returning* the argument's value. |

- `(>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b`:

| argument #1 | `:: m a`        | an action                                                    |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| argument #2 | `:: (a -> m b)` | a suitable Haskell function (a *reaction*)                   |
| result      | `:: m b`        | another action, the result of *binding* the output value of argument #1 (the action) to the input of argument #2 (the reaction). |

- `Promise.resolve(value: T): Promise<T>`:

  | argument | `: T`          | a JavaScript value                                       |
  | -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | result   | `: Promise<T>` | a promise, already *resolved* with the argument's value. |

- `Promise.prototype.then<T, TResult>(this: Promise<T>, onFulfilled: (value: T) => TResult): Promise<TResult>`:

| `this` argument | `: Promise<T>`                       | an action                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| argument        | `: (value: T) => TResult`            | a suitable JavaScript function (a *callback*)                |
| result          | `: Promise<TResult>`\* | another promise, first waiting for `this` (the promise) to resolve, *then* calling the argument (the callback) with the resolved value. |

<div></div>

<aside>
* In fact, nested promises in JavaScript are flattened. The real return value here is typed <code>Promise&lt;Awaited&lt;TResult&gt;&gt;</code>. In Haskell however, it is possible to construct an <code>IO (IO ())</code>, and <code>join</code> is needed to unwrap it.
</aside>

Together, these two operations allow many of the specific (and often-repetitive) details of the computational processes used by actions to be abstracted away. This often makes the monadic interface the preferred choice for *abstract data types*, where the inner workings of monadic actions must be kept private e.g. to ensure they work as intended.

As a reaction uses its argument to build a new monadic result, it can be thought of as an abstract *constructor* for new actions. In this way `return` can then be seen as the trivial-action constructor for new actions: the monadic counterpart to the identity function `Prelude.id`:

As an onFulfilled callback uses its argument to build a new promise, it can be thought of as an abstract *constructor* for new promises. In this way `Promise.resolve` can then be seen as the trivial constructor for new promises: the promise counterpart to the identity function `id`:

```haskell
id   :: a -> a
id x =  x
```

```typescript
function id<T>(x: T): T {
  return x
}
```

### `IO`, in particular

### Top level, in particular

The `IO` type is special because a Haskell program is one large `IO` action (usually) called `main` ‚Äî for any other `IO` action to work, it should be part of the chain of I/O actions composed together to form `main`. Execution of a Haskell program then starts by the Haskell implementation calling `main`, according to the implementation's private definition of the abstract `IO` type.

Top-level code is special because a JavaScript module is one large promise ‚Äî for any other promise to work, it should be constructed in a function called directly or indirectly from top-level. Execution of a JavaScript module then starts by the JavaScript engine running top-level code, according to the implementation's private definition of the `Promise` type.

Assuming:

Assuming:

- `M` is a monadic type;

- `x :: a` is some other Haskell value;

- `m :: M a` is an action;

- `M`, `x`, `m`, `k` are *well-behaved*;

<!---->

- `Promise` is a Promise implementation;

- `x: T` is some other JavaScript value;

- `m: Promise<T>` is a promise;

- `k: (value: T) => Promise<TResult>` is a callback;

- `M`, `x`, `m`, `k` are *well-behaved*;

Even though it is a purely-functional language, Haskell can facilitate the use of effect-based computations by presenting them as monadic actions (using a suitable type), with the monadic interface helping to maintain purity. This is the result of the aforementioned separation of concerns, most notably the *time of composition*. Monadic actions thus resemble programs in a particular [EDSL](https://wiki.haskell.org/EDSL) (*embedded* domain-specific language), "embedded" because they are legitimate Haskell values which *describe* impure computations ‚Äî no extraneous annotations are needed. This is how monadic types in Haskell help keep the *pure* and the *impure* apart. But not all monadic actions are impure ‚Äî for them, the benefits of separating concerns are often combined with the automatic formation of a computational "pipeline".

Because they are very useful in practice but rather confronting for beginners, numerous [monad tutorials](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad_tutorials_timeline) (including this one) exist to help with the learning process.

`do`-notation
-------------

`async` function
----------------

In order to improve the look of code that uses monads, Haskell provides a special form of [syntactic sugar](https://wiki.haskell.org/Syntactic_sugar) called `do`-notation. For example, the following expression:

In order to improve the look of code that uses promises, JavaScript provides a special form of [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) called `async` function. For example, the following expression:

```
thing1 >>= (\x -> func1 x >>= (\y -> thing2 
       >>= (\_ -> func2 y >>= (\z -> return z))))
```

```
thing1.then(x => func1(x).then(y => thing2
      .then(_ => func2(y).then(z => Promise.resolve(z)))))
```

which can be written more clearly by breaking it into several lines and omitting parentheses:

```
thing1  >>= \x ->
func1 x >>= \y ->
thing2  >>= \_ ->
func2 y >>= \z ->
return z
```

```
thing1  .then(x =>
func1(x).then(y =>
thing2  .then(_ =>
func2(y).then(z =>
Promise.resolve(z)))))
```

```
do {
  x <- thing1 ;
  y <- func1 x ;
  thing2 ;
  z <- func2 y ;
  return z
  }
```

```
(async () => {
  const x = await thing1;
  const y = await func1(x);
  await thing2;
  const z = await func2(y);
  return Promise.resolve(z);
})()
```

(the curly braces and the semicolons are optional when the indentation rules are observed).

(the `async function` keywords are allowed in addition to the arrow syntax).

It is possible to intermix the `do`-notation with regular notation.

It is possible to intermix `async` functions with regular functions.

Code written using `do`-notation is transformed by the compiler to ordinary expressions that use the functions from the `Monad` class (i.e. the two varieties of bind: `(>>=)` and `(>>)`).

Code written using `async` functions is transformed by the transpiler to ordinary expressions that use the methods from the `Promise` class (i.e. `Promise.prototype.then`).

The basic mechanical translation for the `do`-notation is as follows:

The basic mechanical translation for `async` functions is as follows:

```
do { x } = x

do { x ; <stmts> }
  = x >> do { <stmts> }

do { v <- x ; <stmts> }
  = x >>= \v -> do { <stmts> }

do { let <decls> ; <stmts> }
  = let <decls> in do { <stmts> }
```

```ts
async () => { return x }
  = () => { return x }

async () => { await x; ... }
  = () => x.then(async () => { ... })

async () => { const v = await x; ... }
  = () => x.then(async v => { ... })

async () => { x; ... }
  = () => { x; return (async () => { ... })() }
```

When using `do`-notation and a monad like `State` or `IO`, programs in Haskell look very much like programs written in an imperative language as each line contains a statement that can change the simulated global state of the program and optionally binds a (local) variable that can be used by the statements later in the code block.

When using `async` functions, asynchronous programs in JavaScript look very much like synchronous programs written for a blocking API as each line contains a statement that waits for the operation to complete and obtains the result immediately.

This gives monadic computations a bit of an imperative feel, but it's important to remember that the monad in question gets to decide what the combination means, and so some unusual forms of control flow might actually occur. In some monads (like parsers, or the list monad), "backtracking" may occur, and in others, even more exotic forms of control might show up (for instance, first-class continuations, or some form of parallelism).

Promises are intentionally limited in that they resolve at most once, so that the synchronous-looking `async` functions behave reasonably. Arrays, for example, have a method called `flatMap` which may invoke the callback many times. Even if `flatMap` were named `then`, arrays can't be taken as promises as they violate the rules of promises. But imagine promises without such limitations.
